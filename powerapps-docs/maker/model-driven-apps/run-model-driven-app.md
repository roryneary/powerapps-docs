# How to run a model-driven app

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

## Running an app in a browser

To run an app in a browser you need to have a had a [security role](../model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary.md#security-role) assigned to you in addition to having the URL for the app.

[how to create a custom security role](../model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app.md#create-a-custom-security-role)

To get the direct link to an app:

1. Edit the app and click the Properties tab
1. Copy the Unified Interface URL.
Paste the app URL in a location so that your users can access it, such as by posting it on a SharePoint site or send via email.

To play the app simply navigate the URL into your browser.

## Running an app on a tablet or mobile

Whilst it is possible to use a URL to run a model-driven app on a mobile device or a tablet the broad guidance consists of downloading the app from the relevant app store, signing into the app using your credentials and then navigating to the specific app required.

# What is Microsoft Power Platform CLI? 

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

> [!NOTE] 
> Effective June 2021, Microsoft Power Apps CLI is rebranded to Microsoft Power Platform CLI. More information: [Blog: Microsoft Power Platform is the best way for teams to build together](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/powerplatform/2021/05/25/microsoft-power-platform-is-the-best-way-for-teams-to-build-together/)<p/>Microsoft Power Platform CLI is currently not available for use in the GCC and GCC High regions.

Microsoft Power Platform CLI is a simple, one-stop developer CLI that empowers developers and ISVs to perform various operations in Microsoft Power Platform related to environment lifecycle, authentication, and work with Microsoft Dataverse environments, solution packages, portals, code components, and so on.  

## Install Microsoft Power Platform CLI

You can use either of the following ways to install Microsoft Power Platform CLI.

### Using Power Platform VS Code Extension

Follow these steps to install Microsoft Power Platform CLI using Visual Studio Code:

1. Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Select **Extensions** icon from the **Activity** panel. In the search bar, enter **Power Platform**.
1. Select **Install**. Once the installation is finished, restart your Visual Studio Code to see the extension within the **Terminal** window.

> [!NOTE]
> Power Platform extension for Visual Studio Code updates automatically. 

1. You can also initiate the install into Visual Studio Code directly from [Marketplace]( https://aka.ms/ppcvscode) and it will launch Visual Studio Code and commence the extension installation.

### Standalone Power Platform CLI

To install standalone Power Platform CLI:

<!--1. Install [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 LTS because it seems to be the most stable.

1. Install [.NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462). 

1. If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of these options:
   - Option 1: Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) or later.
   - Option 2: Install [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2) and then install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)-->
1. Download and install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

1. To take advantage of all the latest capabilities, update Microsoft Power Platform CLI tooling to the latest version by using this command (not applicable for Power Platform VS Code Extension):
    ```CLI
    pac install latest

    ```
> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, Microsoft Power Platform CLI is supported only on Windows 10.
> - Power Platform Extension for VS Code is in public preview, and works on both Windows 10 and macOS.
